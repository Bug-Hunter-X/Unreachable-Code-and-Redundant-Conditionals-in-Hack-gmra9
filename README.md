This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Hack: the compiler's inability to reliably detect unreachable code and redundant conditions. The `bug.hh` file contains examples of functions with unreachable code and redundant conditional statements.  The `bugSolution.hh` offers potential solutions and strategies to mitigate these issues, involving better code design practices and potentially using static analysis tools outside the compiler's inherent capabilities.  This is not a compiler bug per se, but rather a limitation in the type checking that can result in harder-to-debug issues.
